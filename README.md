## About <a name = "about"></a>

This application will help dentists put their patients on a regular follow-up schedule according to each patientâ€™s need. For example, some patients may need regular six months follow-ups to be scheduled, others may need shorter or longer follow-ups. On the other hand, some patients may prefer to call and schedule as needed, so wonâ€™t be placed on a regular follow-up schedule. Once a patient is placed on the follow-up schedule, the application will calculate the next follow-up date according to the follow-up frequency chosen and the last visit date. Each time the patient attends their follow-up visit, they can be checked out and returned to the follow-up schedule with the next follow-up date being calculated automatically.
